# Task 4: Create Dashboards

**What you'll do:** Build visual dashboards to monitor system health  
**Time:** 20 minutes

## Why We Need This

Data without visualization is hard to understand. Dashboards turn your monitoring data into clear, actionable information. It's the difference between looking at a spreadsheet of numbers vs. seeing a graph that clearly shows "your application is getting slower."

We'll create dashboards that show:
- How healthy your application is
- How much resources it's using
- Any errors or problems

---

## Step 1: Navigate and Explore

```bash
# Go to the dashboards directory  
cd ../04-dashboards

# See what we have
ls -la
```

**What you'll see:**
- `dashboards/` - Pre-built dashboard definitions (4 professional dashboards)
- `deploy-enhanced-setup.sh` - Script to load dashboards into Grafana
- `validate-dashboards.sh` - Script to check dashboards are working
- `validate-datasources.sh` - Script to verify data connections

## Step 2: Import Pre-built Dashboards

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x deploy-enhanced-setup.sh

# Import the dashboards
./deploy-enhanced-setup.sh
```

**What this does:**
- Creates a dedicated folder in Grafana for workshop dashboards
- Takes our 4 pre-built professional dashboard configurations  
- Uploads them to your Grafana instance
- Connects them to your Prometheus and Loki data
- Generates test traffic to populate the dashboards with data

**You'll see:** Success messages as each dashboard is imported and test data is generated.

## Step 3: Explore the Application Dashboard

**In your browser, go back to Grafana:** `http://localhost:3000`

1. **Look for "DevOps Workshop" folder** in the left sidebar
2. **Click to expand the folder** - you'll see all 4 dashboards organized together
3. **Click "Application Overview"** dashboard
4. **Look at the panels** showing:
   - Request rate (how many requests per second)
   - Response times (how fast your app responds)
   - Error rate (how many requests fail)
   - CPU and memory usage of your app

**Note:** The script already generated test traffic, so you should see data immediately!

## Step 4: Generate Some Traffic

**Let's create some activity to see in our dashboards:**

```bash
# Generate traffic to your application (open a new terminal)
for i in {1..100}; do curl http://localhost:8080; sleep 1; done
```

**What this does:** Makes 100 requests to your application, one per second.

**Go back to Grafana** and watch the dashboards update in real-time!

**You should see:**
- Request rate increasing
- Response time graphs showing activity
- CPU usage might increase slightly

## Step 5: Explore Infrastructure Monitoring

1. **In Grafana, look for the "DevOps Workshop" folder** in the left sidebar
2. **Click to expand the folder**
3. **Click "Infrastructure Monitoring"**
4. **Look at:**
   - Node CPU usage (your computer's CPU)
   - Memory usage across all nodes
   - Pod status (how many are running/failed)
   - Network traffic

## Step 6: Check Application Logs

1. **Click "Explore"** in the left menu of Grafana
2. **Select "Loki" as the data source**  
## Step 6: Explore Log Analysis

1. **In the "DevOps Workshop" folder, click "Log Analysis"** dashboard
2. **Look at the log visualization panels:**
   - Log volume over time
   - Error vs success logs
   - Most recent log entries
3. **Click "Log browser"** 
4. **Select your application logs**

**You should see:** Real-time logs from your application showing the requests generated by the script.

## Step 7: Check SRE Golden Signals

1. **In the "DevOps Workshop" folder, click "SRE Golden Signals"** dashboard
2. **Explore the four key metrics:**
   - **Latency** - How fast your application responds
   - **Traffic** - How many requests you're getting
   - **Errors** - How many requests are failing  
   - **Saturation** - How much of your resources are being used

**These are the "Four Golden Signals"** that Google's Site Reliability Engineering team uses to monitor all their services!

## Step 8: Test Your Monitoring

**Let's see what happens when something goes wrong:**

```bash
# Stop your application temporarily  
kubectl scale deployment sample-app --replicas=0 -n devops-app
```

**Watch your dashboards:**
- Request rate should drop to zero
- Application status should show problems  
- Your alert should trigger

```bash
# Bring your application back
kubectl scale deployment sample-app --replicas=3 -n devops-app

# Wait a moment and check
kubectl get pods -n devops-app
```

**Watch the dashboards recover** as your application comes back online.

## What Just Happened?

1. **You created professional monitoring dashboards** - The same type used by major companies
2. **You saw real-time observability** - Changes in your system immediately visible in graphs  
3. **You set up alerting** - Automatic notification when things go wrong
4. **You tested failure scenarios** - Saw how monitoring helps you detect and resolve problems
5. **You experienced the full DevOps cycle** - From code to infrastructure to monitoring
