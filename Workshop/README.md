# DevOps Course: Infrastructure as Code & Observability

A 4-hour hands-on course that teaches you to build and monitor infrastructure using modern DevOps tools.

## üöÄ Before You Start

### Install Required Tools

You'll need these tools installed on your computer:

**1. Docker Desktop**
- macOS: Download from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) or run `brew install --cask docker`
- Linux: `curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh && sudo sh get-docker.sh`
- Windows: Download from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (ensure WSL2 is enabled)

**2. Terraform**
- macOS: `brew install terraform`
- Linux: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform`
- Windows: Download from [terraform.io](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)

**3. kubectl**
- macOS: `brew install kubectl`
- Linux: `curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl" && sudo install kubectl /usr/local/bin/`
- Windows: Download from [kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-windows/)

**4. Kind (Kubernetes in Docker)**
- macOS: `brew install kind`
- Linux: `curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.20.0/kind-linux-amd64 && chmod +x ./kind && sudo mv ./kind /usr/local/bin/`
- Windows: Download from [kind.sigs.k8s.io](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation)

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Check all tools are installed
./scripts/verify-setup.sh
```

**Expected output:** All tools should show ‚úÖ green checkmarks.
